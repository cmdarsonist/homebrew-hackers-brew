# Hackers' üç∫ Brew 
> *A Homebrew / Linuxbrew tap to install InfoSec and Hacking Tools and Utilities on Linux, BSD, and macOS.*

üéØ The **objective** of this tap is to simplify the distribution of **InfoSec / Hacking tools and utilities** on **a wide-range of Linux Distros** and **macOS**. 

**_There's also an intention to support BSD but currently, it is very experimental. Progress is dependant on Homebrew support with BSD._**

---
### ü§î Wait, why Homebrew üçª?
**Homebrew** üçª is one of the few **package üì¶ managers**  that is aiming to **support multiple OSs (i.e.
macOS, Linux, WSL, BSD)**.

üëâ Utilizing **Homebrew** üçª and **this tap**, we intend to **provide üéÅ users** with **OS agnostic solution to install, setup, and deploy their InfoSec / Hacking toolbelt** through the use of a single uniform tool üîß.

## üíæ Install
```bash
brew tap open-arsenal/hackers-brew
```
üñê *If it's not obvious*, you **must** have first installed üëâ [**Homebrew on macOS**](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) **or** üëâ [**Linux**](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux). 

**üëâ For BSD, [may try these instructions to install Homebrew; which are translated to English.](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&u=https://qiita.com/cielavenir/items/741921fcecb281555f77&prev=search)** [[Original Link in Japanese](https://qiita.com/cielavenir/items/741921fcecb281555f77)]

### üõ° Prepare Your System
If you haven't taken any steps in securing your OS, we recommend you take a look at the following guides and do whatever you deem necessary:

- üí™ **macOS**: [@drduh's](https://github.com/drduh) [masOS Security and Privacy Guide](https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-Guide)
- üí™ **Linux (Debian)**: [@drduh's](https://github.com/drduh) [Debian Security and Privacy Guide](https://github.com/drduh/Debian-Privacy-Server-Guide)
