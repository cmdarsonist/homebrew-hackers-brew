# Hackers' 🍺 Brew 
> *A Homebrew / Linuxbrew tap to install InfoSec, Reverse Engineering, and Hacking Tools and Utilities on Linux, BSD, and macOS.*

🎯 The **objective** of this tap is to simplify the distribution of **a wide range of InfoSec, Reverse Engineering, Hacking tools and utilities** on **a wide-range of Linux Distros** and **macOS**. 

**📝 Theres also an intention to support BSD but currently, it is very experimental. Progress is dependant on Brew's support with BSD.**

### 🤔 Wait, why Homebrew 🍻?
**Homebrew** 🍻 is one of the few **package 📦 managers**  that is aiming to **support multiple OSs (i.e.
macOS, Linux, WSL, BSD)**.

👉 Utilizing **Homebrew** 🍻 and **this tap**, we intend to **provide users** with **OS agnostic solution to install, setup, and deploy their InfoSec / Reverse Engineering / Hacking toolbelt** through the use of **a single uniform tool 🔧**.

## 💾 Install
```bash
brew tap open-arsenal/hackers-brew
```
🖐 *If it's not obvious*, you **must** have first installed 👉 [**Homebrew (on macOS)**](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) **or** 👉 [**Linuxbrew (on Linux)**](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux). 

**👉 For BSD, [may try these instructions to install Homebrew; which are translated to English.](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&u=https://qiita.com/cielavenir/items/741921fcecb281555f77&prev=search)** [[Original Link in Japanese](https://qiita.com/cielavenir/items/741921fcecb281555f77)]
